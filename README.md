[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://app-doc-digester.streamlit.app/)

This RAG based document chatbot app with memory is created using Streamlit, Python and uses gpt-3.5-turbo model. 

You can upload either a pdf, txt, or docx file of size upto 3MB and converse with the document! Ask any questions about the contents of the document and the chatbot will answer your questions about it to the best of its ability. 

The chatbot remembers the context of the conversation. If you ask 'What is the capital of California' and then ask 'And what is it's population', the chatbot knows you are asking about the population of Sacramento.
